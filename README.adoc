== Docs

TODO: Point to docs hosted on cljdoc - once we publish.

== Versioning

rewrite-cljc versioning scheme is: `major`.`minor`.`patch`-`test-qualifier`

* `major` increments when the API has been broken - something, as a rule, we'd like to avoid.
* `minor` increments to convey significant new features have been added.
* `patch` indicates bug fixes - it is the number of commits since `major`.`minor`.
* `test-qualifier` is absent for stable releases. Can be `alpha`, `beta`, `rc1`, etc.
