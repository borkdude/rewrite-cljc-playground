A library that reads and writes Clojure, ClojureScript and [EDN](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) from Clojure and ClojureScript in a whitespace and comment preserving way.

## Status

TODO: badges here... circleci, cljdoc, clojars

rewrite-cljc versioning scheme is: `major`.`minor`.`patch`

* `major` increments when the API has been broken - something, as a rule, we'd like to avoid.
* `minor` increments to convey significant new features have been added.
* `patch` indicates bug fixes - it is the number of commits since `major`.`minor`.
